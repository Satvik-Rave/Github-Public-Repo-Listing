# GitHub Public Repository Lister Application
### This is a GitHub public repository lister application that provides all the publically available repositories of a particular user.
This application is made by using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with API integration to fetch GitHub data.
* The per-page limit of listing varies from 5 to 100 items per page.
* The application is hosted over GitHub pages for a live view on this link-
https://satvik-rave.github.io/Github-Public-Repo-Listing/
* The boxes highlighted in blue are the topics (languages/frameworks).
* Using the search bar one can search the repository name and it will be displayed if present in the list.
* The names of the repositories are links to the GitHub repository. 
* This is a fully responsive website that can run over different screens.

## Steps to run the application-
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the javascript file and change the "user" variable in the first line to fetch its data.
3. Run the application over a live server.

## Note
* Direct link available with a pre-set user.
* Using the GitHub auth token, the developer can increase the limit on the number of API calls, currently it is 60 calls per hour.

## Future scope-
1. The application will take the user name as input to search the repositories associated with it rather than taking a static input.
2. More optimized search as an application user starts typing in the search bar instead of clicking the submit button.
